# Freds-Grand-Rapids-Restaurant-List
A list of dishes and restaurants in Grand Rapids with recommendations

## Summary
A friend asked me for a list of restaurant recommendation in Grand Rapids. The food around here is fantastic, so
it's hard to know which ones to try. Additionally, I wanted to keep a list of restaurants that I intend to try. 
Feel free to submit more for me, especially with dish recommendations!

These are obviously personal opinions, and based on limited experience.

### Top Favorites
Each section is roughly in order of my preference.

#### Sit Down
These are places where you should go for a nice sit down dinner or long lunch. There's no reason you can't go to lunch at these places, but it's not "in and out" like the others.

| Restaurant | Location | Style | Recommended Dish(es) | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| [Electric Cheetah](https://www.electriccheetah.com/) | East Hills | Sandwiches (modern) |  | Menu changes frequently. Also has a Root Beer menu. |
| Uncle Cheetah's Soup Shop | East Hills | Soup and Sandwiches (modern) | Absolutely Everything | For lunch, get there before 11:45 or the layout of the place makes it awkward. |
| Green Well | East Hills | New American | Spaetzle | Their menu changes frequently, and everything is good, but they seem to really know what to do with Spaetzel. |
| Bistro Bella Vita | Downtown | New American | Beef Bourguignon | Same owners as green well but slightly fancier. |
| Grove | East Hills | Farm to Table | Tasting Menu | Expensive, but the tasting menu lets you get an appetizer, main, and dessert for $35. |
| Bosna Express | 28th & 131 | Bosnian | Grille Platter or Cevapi | Despite the name, is a sitdown restaurant. |
| San Chez Bistro | Downtown | Tapas | Any and all | Shrimp with bananas? Crazy! Crazy delicious! |
| Sheshco | Knapps Corner | Meditteranean | Bread and garlic | Bread and garlic comes with every meal. You want more. |
| Thai Fusion | Rockford / 28th and Beltline | Thai | Red Curry Fried Rice (extra curry!) |  |

#### Short Order
Places where you can grab a quick bite. Often order at the counter and take to your own table.
