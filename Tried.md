#### Tried
These are restaurants I've tried, but didn't make the list. I may have ordered the wrong thing. I may have been there on a bad night. I may have just been in a bad mood. It's probably more me than them.

| Restaurant | Location | Style | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|
| MeXo | Downtown-ish | Mexican (ancient) | Great service and loved the atmosphere. Food lacked seasoning. Seafood dish didn't match menu description. |
| Knickerbocker | Downtown | American | Dishes were uninspired and cold. Plenty of seating and good beer, though. |
| The Friesan | Midtown | New American | The "pork belly burnt ends" appetizer was really good, but the lamb chops were flavorless and gross. |
